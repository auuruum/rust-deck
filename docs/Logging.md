Logging
Logging is a useful way track the flow of functionality, and can assist with diagnosing bugs within your plugin. By default, the Stream Deck SDK provides support for logging between the runtime consoles, as well as writing logs to the file system.

In this guide you'll learn:

How to write log entries using the Stream Deck SDK.
Where your plugin's logs are located.
Using log levels and logger scopes to help identify logs.
Writing Logs
Logs are written using a Logger instance, with the root logger located on the default streamDeck import, for example:

Info level log
import streamDeck from "@elgato/streamdeck";
streamDeck.logger.info("Hello world");
streamDeck.connect();

tip
It is recommended to use streamDeck.logger instead of console. Using streamDeck.logger ensures your plugin's logs are written to all available targets, for example the LOG file.

Reading Logs
All logs written to a logger are output to targets based on the source of the log entry, and the plugin's environment, for example whether it is in production or development. The log targets are:

Source	Environment	Targets
Plugin	Development	
File
Console (Plugin)
Property Inspector (UI)	Development	
File
Console (Plugin)
Console (UI)
Plugin	Production

Log Files
File logging is provided as standard, allowing for writing logs to LOG files. These LOG files are found within your plugin's logs directory, for example:

com.elgato.hello-world.sdPlugin/logs/com.elgato.hello-world.0.log
└─────────┬──────────┘               └─────────┬──────────┘ └──┐
     Plugin UUID                          Plugin UUID        Index

warning
Uninstalling a plugin will also remove its associated log files. When diagnosing issues, we recommend requesting the logs prior to suggesting a re-install.

Format
Logs are written in the following format:

<iso_date> <log_level> [[scope]: ]<message>

For example:

com.elgato.hello-world.sdPlugin/logs/com.elgato.hello-world.0.log
2024-05-05T12:35:13.000Z INFO  Hello world

File Rotation
The file target also provides automatic file rotation of your plugin's log files, this means that:

Your plugin's 10 most recent log files are available, with 0 being the most recent.
Log files never exceed 10 MiB.
File rotation occurs, i.e. a new log file is created and the oldest removed, when one of the following occurs:

Your plugin starts.
The current log file exceeds 10 MiB.
Console
Whilst developing your plugin, logs are also mirrored to the various consoles supported by the Stream Deck SDK. The supported consoles are:

The Node.js terminal when debugging your plugin.
The browser console when debugging your property inspectors.
Where available, the console logger maps one-to-one with the native console to provide more insightful messages and familiarity. The mapping is as follows:

Logger vs Console
import streamDeck from "@elgato/streamdeck";
// console.error(...)
streamDeck.logger.error("Failures or exceptions");
// console.warn(...)
streamDeck.logger.warn("Recoverable errors");
// console.log(...);
streamDeck.logger.info("Hello world");
streamDeck.logger.debug("Debugging information");
streamDeck.logger.trace("Detailed messages");
streamDeck.connect();

Log Level
Log entries are associated with log levels to assist with indicating their severity. In the previous chapter, you created an INFO log entry using:

streamDeck.logger.info("Hello world");

In addition to INFO, it is also possible to create a log with one of the following log levels:

Log levels
import streamDeck from "@elgato/streamdeck";
streamDeck.logger.error("Failures or exceptions");
streamDeck.logger.warn("Recoverable errors");
streamDeck.logger.info("Hello world");
streamDeck.logger.debug("Debugging information");
streamDeck.logger.trace("Detailed messages");
streamDeck.connect();

Level	Value	Description
Error
LogLevel.ERROR	Logs that require immediate attention. For example, module failure, unexpected behavior, or data loss/corruption.
Warning
LogLevel.WARN	Represents abnormal behavior, but a recoverable state. For example, a value resorting to a fallback value.
Information
LogLevel.INFO	General information.
Debug
LogLevel.DEBUG	Log entries for debugging and development. For example, variable values.
Trace
LogLevel.TRACE	Detailed entries for analyzing the context and flow of execution. For example, network traffic, IPC communication. These entries may contain sensitive information.
You can also control lowest level that will be written to the logger, for example if you want to only log error and warning messages, you would do the following:

Setting the log level
import streamDeck, { LogLevel } from "@elgato/streamdeck";
streamDeck.logger.setLevel(LogLevel.WARN);
streamDeck.logger.error("Failures or exceptions");
streamDeck.logger.warn("Recoverable errors");
streamDeck.logger.info("Hello world"); // No output.
streamDeck.logger.debug("Debugging information"); // No output.
streamDeck.logger.trace("Detailed messages"); // No output.
streamDeck.connect();

warning
The default log level is dependent on the mode of the plugin:

Development, the default log level is DEBUG.
Production, the default log level is INFO, with DEBUG being the lowest possible level.
Creating Loggers
Additional child loggers may be created from an existing logger, each of which is called a "scope." A scope can be useful to identify the source of a log message, with the scopes acting as breadcrumbs. For example:

Scoped loggers
import streamDeck from "@elgato/streamdeck";
const scopedLogger = streamDeck.logger.createScope("Main");
scopedLogger.info("Hello world");
streamDeck.connect();

com.elgato.hello-world.sdPlugin/logs/com.elgato.hello-world.0.log
2024-05-05T12:35:13.000Z INFO  Main: Hello world

Scoped loggers can also be nested, for example:

Nested scoped loggers
import streamDeck from "@elgato/streamdeck";
const scopedLogger = streamDeck.logger.createScope("Main");
scopedLogger.info("Hello world");
const nestedLogger = scopedLogger.createScope("Nested");
nestedLogger.info("Test");
streamDeck.connect();

com.elgato.hello-world.sdPlugin/logs/com.elgato.hello-world.0.log
2024-05-05T12:35:13.000Z INFO  Main: Hello world
2024-05-05T12:35:13.000Z INFO  Main->Nested: Test

Stream Deck Logs
In addition to the logs written by your plugin, the Stream Deck app also writes logs to help diagnose issues.

On Windows, logs are located at %appdata%\Elgato\StreamDeck\logs\.
On macOS, logs are located at ~/Library/Logs/ElgatoStreamDeck/.
Stream Deck uses a log rotation in which each run of the app creates a new log file, with the most recent log file being StreamDeck0.log.
